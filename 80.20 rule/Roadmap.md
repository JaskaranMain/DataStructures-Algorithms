ðŸš€ Java 80/20 Learning Roadmap (6 Weeks Plan)
âœ… Goal: Master the essential 20% of Java that is used in 80% of real-world projects (backend development, freelancing, and job interviews).

ðŸ•’ Time Commitment: 4-6 hours per day

ðŸ“Œ Week 1: Java Fundamentals (Absolute Must-Know)
ðŸ”¹ Java Syntax & Basics â€“ Data types, variables, operators
ðŸ”¹ Control Flow â€“ If-else, loops (for, while, do-while), switch
ðŸ”¹ Methods & Functions â€“ Parameters, return types, method overloading
ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling â€“ Try-catch, throws, finally, custom exceptions

ðŸ›  Practice: Solve at least 20-30 small coding problems using OOP concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Week 2: Collections & Java 8+ Features (Most Used in Projects)
ðŸ”¹ Collections Framework â€“ List, Set, Map, Queue (ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet)
ðŸ”¹ Streams & Functional Programming â€“ Lambda expressions, Streams API, Method References
ðŸ”¹ Java 8+ Features â€“ Optional, Functional Interfaces, Default & Static Methods in Interfaces
ðŸ”¹ Multithreading & Concurrency â€“ Threads, Runnable, ExecutorService

ðŸ›  Practice: Implement real-world use cases using collections (e.g., Employee Management System).

ðŸ“Œ Week 3: File Handling, JVM Internals & Database Connectivity
ðŸ”¹ File Handling & I/O â€“ Reading/Writing files (BufferedReader, FileWriter)
ðŸ”¹ JVM Internals â€“ Memory Management, Garbage Collection
ðŸ”¹ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) â€“ CRUD operations using MySQL/PostgreSQL
ðŸ”¹ Basic Hibernate â€“ Mapping Java objects to database tables (JPA, Hibernate)

ðŸ›  Practice: Build a small CRUD app using JDBC and MySQL.

ðŸ“Œ Week 4: Spring Boot for Backend Development (Industry Standard)
ðŸ”¹ Spring Boot Basics â€“ Creating REST APIs
ðŸ”¹ Dependency Injection & Annotations
ðŸ”¹ Spring Boot with Database â€“ CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA
ðŸ”¹ Authentication & Security â€“ JWT, OAuth, Role-Based Access Control
ðŸ”¹ Testing â€“ Writing unit tests with JUnit & Mockito

ðŸ›  Practice: Build a User Management System with Spring Boot & MySQL.

ðŸ“Œ Week 5: Real-World Project & Cloud Deployment
ðŸ”¹ Project Structure & Best Practices
ðŸ”¹ Logging & Monitoring â€“ Log4j, Micrometer
ðŸ”¹ Cloud Deployment â€“ Hosting on AWS/GCP
ðŸ”¹ Docker & Containers â€“ Running Java apps in containers

ðŸ›  Practice: Deploy your Spring Boot Project to AWS (EC2/RDS).

ðŸ“Œ Week 6: Interview & Freelancing Readiness
ðŸ”¹ DSA with Java (Basics for Interviews) â€“ Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Sorting
ðŸ”¹ System Design Basics â€“ REST APIs, Microservices, Caching, Load Balancing
ðŸ”¹ Mock Interviews & Freelancing Setup â€“ Build a Fiverr/Upwork profile, list Java services

ðŸ›  Practice: Solve 30-40 DSA questions + apply for Java freelancing gigs.
