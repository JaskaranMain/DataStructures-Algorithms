# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository showcases my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems, organized by categories. It also includes small projects that demonstrate the application of DSA in real-world scenarios.
<br>

<h4>🔥 Tips for Effective Learning</h4>
-Focus on Patterns instead of just solutions.<br>
-Use Leetcode, GFG, CodeStudio for practicing.<br>
-Solve at least 4-5 problems daily.<br>
-Watch tutorials (CodeWithHarry, Striver, Love Babbar).<br>
-Revise & Take Notes (Write down key formulas & approaches).<br>
