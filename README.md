# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository showcases my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems, organized by categories. It also includes small projects that demonstrate the application of DSA in real-world scenarios.

So Currently i will follow stiver DSA A2Z sheet for preparation and learning.

## Features
- Categorized solutions for easy navigation.
- Optimized and well-documented code in Java.
- Algorithm visualizations and problem-solving applications.
