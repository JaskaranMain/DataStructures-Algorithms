## Since you have 1.5 months and need DSA for interviews, focus on essential topics rather than advanced ones.

#### 🔥 Tips for Effective Learning
- Focus on Patterns instead of just solutions.  
- Use **Leetcode**, **GFG**, **CodeStudio** for practicing.  
- Solve at least **4-5 problems daily**.  
- Watch tutorials (**CodeWithHarry**, **Striver**, **Love Babbar**).  
- Revise & Take Notes (Write down key formulas & approaches).
